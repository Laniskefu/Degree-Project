class Numeric(Array):
    """
    Numeric classes in MATLABÂ® include signed and unsigned integers,
    and single-precision and double-precision floating-point numbers.
    By default, MATLAB stores all numeric values as double-precision floating point.
    (You cannot change the default type and precision.)
    You can choose to store any number, or array of numbers, as integers or as single-precision.
    Integer and single precision arrays offer more memory-efficient storage than double precision.

    All numeric types support basic array operations, such as indexing, reshaping, and mathematical operations.
